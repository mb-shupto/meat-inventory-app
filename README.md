Meat Inventory Management System
This is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to manage a meat processing facility's inventory. The system helps track products, monitor stock levels, prevent waste from expiration, and ensure food safety through a traceability and recall system.
üåü Features
Product Management: Define and manage different meat products (e.g., animal type, cut, shelf life).
Inventory Tracking: Add and deplete stock with specific quantities, batch numbers, and expiration dates.
Expiration Alerts: A dashboard to automatically display products that are nearing their expiration date, helping to reduce waste.
Reporting & Analytics: Generate reports on total inventory value and quantities by product type, with data visualizations (charts).
Traceability & Recall: A system to log and manage product recalls by batch number, a critical feature for food safety compliance.
User Authentication: Secure registration and login for users with a role-based access control system (admin, manager, employee).
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: React, React Hooks, React Chart.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcrypt
State Management: React Context API
